						The fate of most applications is often sealed before a single
						line of code has been written. How is that possible?
						Simply, bad design assures bad results. Good design and effective processes
						are the foundation on which maintainable applications are built,
						scaled, and improved. For JavaScript developers, this means 
						discovering the tooling, modern libraries, and architectural patterns
						that enable those improvements.
					</p>
					<p>
						<span id="title">JavaScript Application Design: A Build First Approach</span> introduces
						techniques to improve software quality and development workflow.
						You'll begin by learning how to establish processes designed to optimize
						the quality of your work. You'll execute tasks whenever your code changes,
						run tests on every commit, and deploy in an automated fashion. Then, you'll
						focus on designing modular components and composing them together to
						build robust applications.
